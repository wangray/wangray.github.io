I currently work for Apple CoreOS and studied computer science at MIT, where I co-started the MIT security club and CTF team, [TechSec](https://techsec.mit.edu/index.html).

This humble blog is mostly a reference for my forgetful future self. I'll be posting CTF writeups, projects I'm working on, things I think are worth sharing, and some other personal bric-a-brac. I hope that other curious netizens may glean something useful from my blog as well.
